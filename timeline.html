            <h3>Brainstorming - Take 1</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">
                    <p>We had an intense brainstorming session in class where we covered a wide range of topics. The main fields that our brainstorming evolved at were: cooking, medical, communication, education, law enforcement, art, sports, fun and house.</p>
                    <h4>Problem Area and User Needs - 3D Model Manipulation</h4>
                    <p>The application area we chose to tackle is 3D model navigation and manipulation for designers and architects. The current solution for viewing models on a screen involves rotating, panning and zooming using the mouse and the keyboard. However the controls for manipulating the different axes using the current hardware is challenging and counter-intuitive. Even though with enough time experts in the field get used to the idiosyncrasies of the controller mapping, the state-of-the-art system offers a discouraging learning curve for novices, or the clients the experts would have to interact with.</p>
                    <p>We think that exploring the design space for more natural methods using the Kinect will open up possibilities for navigating and manipulating virtual models. We think that using the depth information available with the Kinect sensor, we can produce methods with much better “walk-up” usability.</p>

            <h3>Brainstorming - Take 2</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8">
                    <p>We decided to get together again to brainstorm ideas on the project scope because our original idea seemed to be more solution-oriented rather than problem-oriented. Furthermore, we weren't able to clearly identify a compelling reason for our target group to pick our gesture-oriented technology over existing alternatives. </p>
                    <p>Our second brainstormed resulted in two main application areas: gesture-oriented TV control for future generation TVs such as Apple TV and Google TV, and sports and fitness applications.</p>
                    <h4>Problem Area and User Needs - Gesture-oriented Interface for TV</h4>
                    <p>Ever since Apple TV and Google TV were announced, the TV industry has shifted its products to a more interactive experience for the users rather than maintaining its traditional role as passively providing information. We are looking at various areas where the user can interface the TV without using any device. For example, one area that is interesting is text-input. Current solutions involve using a keyboard, which is very inconvenient.</p>

The attached photos shows the questions we planned on asking. We then listed out potential application areas within the TV space, and narrowed down to 3 possible areas: TV-personalization, web-browsing, interactive commercials, and social TV.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">
                    <h4>Use Case</h4>
                    <p>This first storyboard explores one possible use case for a TV that is aware of its user and his/her taste profile. Users record signature gestures and can then use these gestures to sign-in to the TV.</p>
                    <p>Once the user is signed in, the TV will switch to the content that best fits the current user's taste profile. The user can then indicate feedback by giving a thumbs up or thumbs down, both of which are saved to enhance future recommendations. The user can get a new show that they like and is on at that time with the thumbs down gesture. Also, if more than one user is present, the TV will find a show that best fits both profiles.</p>
                    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>Some of the learnings we got from this prototype include limiting of interactivity. With the TV deciding on the list of shows to display, the user doesn't have the capability to navigate to a new, different show that he or she might have just found out about. However this can be overcome by giving an alternative input method.</p>

                    <h4>Use Case</h4>
                    <p>
                        This first storyboard explores one possible use case for a TV that is aware of the user's presence and user's  taste profile. In this instance however, the Kinect-TV is passively detecting and recognizing subjects infront of the TV and learning what shows the user likes to watch and suggesting appropriate shows for them 
                    </p>

                    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-latin;">
                        <li>TV is off.</li>
                        <li>Mom walks in front of screen, Kinect detects her and TV turns on.</li>
                        <li>Kinect does facial and body recognition. It recognizes Mom and welcomes her.</li>
                        <li>Knowing what shows Mom likes, the Kinect-TV suggests shows that are currently playing that mom likes. She has the option of Martha Stewart or CNN News. She can point left for Martha Stewart and right for CNN News.</li>
                        <li>Mom Points right and the Kinect changes the channel to CNN.</li>
                        <li>Mom watches the show for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Mom's show is done and the Kinect-TV suggests next shows that are own that she might like.</li>
                        <li>As this happens her son comes into the room.</li>
                        <li>The Kinect-TV detects the son and mom are watching tv.</li>
                        <li>The Kinect-TV runs body and facial recognition on the subjects.</li>
                        <li>The TV welcomes both mom and son and gives suggestions for current shows that they both like to wath together.</li>
                        <li>Mom and son are happy.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>Privacy:  In looking at the passive detection of people in front of the screen a lot of users might find this a bit intrusive, like they are being watched by the tv.  Many people might not like that through this passive mode, data is being collected about them all the time.</p>
                    <p>Detection: With passive detection, this can lead to situations when multiple people walk in front of the screen but only 1 person is actually interested in watching tv.</p>
                    <p>Multiple Persons:  With multiple people, tv watchers might not want to watch their group shows and instead want to watch an individual's show but still have two people watching tv.  This kinect-TV mode should be something activated by the tv watchers and not forced on them to watch shows that are only suggested to them.</p>

            <h3>Personalized TV - Storyboard 3</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">
                    <h4>Use case</h4>
                    <p>This third storyboard explores the possibility of the user using gesture to perform text-input. The user is watching LOST but wants to change a show. By setting his TV into text-input-mode, hec an start to move his hand to perform the text-input. When the user moves his right hand into an upside-down "V"-shape, the TV automatically does fuzzy matches to match it with "A" and "N", amongother letters (which he can scroll down to from the right). He then moves his hand in a circle, and the TV matches his hand to a "D" and an "O", among others. Lastly, he moves his hand into an "8" shape, and the TV matches it with "8" and "B". He scrolls through to find his favorite show, "No. 8", and enjoys the show.</p>
                    <h4> Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>Clutch: In order to avoid false positives, the user will need to use some sort of clutch to letthe TV know when the "text-input-mode" is on. The clutch could either be done with a remote or with the left hand.</p>
                    <p>It may be a good idea to explore the possibility of only using gesture-controlled features for text-input and leaving everything else to the remote. It seems like almost every other function in the TV is a lot easier with a remote or a smartphone rather than gestures. However, with text-input, using a remote to select letters is extremely painful, so as gesture-based input makes sense.</p>

            <h3>Watching TV - Personal Experience</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">

                    <h4>Rationale</h4>
                    <p>In order to experience what TV watchers are doing and feeling, we did the arduous task of of watching TV for 30 minutes.  We learned the following in relaion to Storyboard 2.</p>
                    <h4> Lessons Learned </h4>
                    <p>TV Watching Positions : People watch TV in a variety of positions: reclining, sitting up, standing, in front of laptops, lying down completely.</p>
                    <p>TV Movement: People get up and down frequently while watching TV.  Leave during commercials for food or to go to the bathroom.  Need to be able to deal with people still watching tv even if they aren't in the kinects view.</p>
                    <p> Even though we watched TV alone, we would still laugh, yell, shout, and emote to the screen, as if someone were actually there.</p>
                    <p> Content: When watching Cable TV, the choices are too many. When watching TV from your computer, you usually go directly toward the show you want. What's the middle ground? Is there a way to make show-selection easier for those who have the 'fear of missing out' on the best show?</p>

            <h3>Interactive TV--Custom Input and Feedback</h3>			
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">
                    <h4>Rationale</h4>
                    <p> One idea for the future of TV was to interact with the content itself. When you're watching a show alone, laughs are accompanied by the sitcom-pre-recorded laughs. What if you could see what other people thought was funny? When if you could tell when other people were yelling at the refs in a sports match? </p>

                    <p> The question that this looks-like prototype addressed is exactly what makes sense for a system like this to look like. Given that TV shows have sound, there would need to be some kind of unobstructive visual feedback. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Voice recognition: Could TVs just recognize your laugh and use that?</li>
                        <li>In-Show comments: At a turning point in the TV show, what if you could easily provide feedback about whether you thought something was awkward, cute, or upsetting?</li>
                        <li>Post-show discussion: During the credits for the show, could you see what others thought of it as well?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There is no one-interface fits all; different shows use different parts of the screen, so having a single selection interface during TV in general would inhibit the experience for some shows. Programming multiple targets for the show seems tough; implicit gesture for voice may be better than target or text selection.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Laughing out loud alone was awkward when no one else was in the room and when no laughter was present in the show.
                        </li>

            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p> We wanted to be able to see how well the Kinect could recognize reclining and relaxed individuals. We realize that the TV is usually a place where people come together and hang out--mostly sitting down. A lot of the current Kinect games ask you to stand up, so we wanted to see what happens if someone gets too close to the camera</p>


            <h3>Interactive TV--Custom Camera Views</h3>

            <p>An idea for the future of TV was the following: let's say there is a live concert on TV. Several cameras are filming it: one for the guitarist, one for the drummer, one for the audience, one for the stage, etc. What if it was possible to choose the camera we want to watch in real time?</p>
            <p>The first question we could ask is: when would that possibility be appropriate? We could think of different application areas: concerts, sports, documentaries, TV reality shows.</p>
            <p>The second is even more interesting here since it was actually possible to make a tangible prototype to find the answer: What is a good way to select camera views?</p>
            <p>More generally, this question has a much larger scope. It is about the selection of almost any object on a screen. We could group those gestures in three categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pointer selection: the user has to point at the object he wants to select on the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Radial selection: the user makes a gesture towards the zone of the screen where the object he wants to select is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drawing selection: if the objects have an index (a number or a letter for example), the user "draws" with his hand this number or letter.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following videos show the three types of interaction (we recommend you to watch them in full-screen mode).</p>

            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pointer selection: this selection may be the more direct and natural, but there is (at least) one big flaw. The first one is that this pointer needs a kind of calibration. When the user points at something on the screen, there is little chance that the pointer actually falls exactly where he expected to. He may have to correct the position of his arm. This is particularly true if the items to select are in a tight vertical list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Radial selection: an obvious flaw that we could spot as soon as we tested this prototype is that you have to be on a decent sitting position to be able to select a zone of the screen. If you are lying on a side (let's say the right side), it is very difficult to direct your arm to the right. On the contrary, this selection method has a big advantage compared to the previous one: if the expanse of the gesture can be small, it would not only solve the problem of the posture but it may also be very easy to navigate into menus and sub-menus. Indeed, there is no need to calibrate anything since the only parameter that matters is the angle of your arm. Reaching a particular sub-menu could finally be like drawing a path that the user could learn subconciously. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drawing selection: the two main advantages of this method is that the user can be in any position, and that it is not tiring since the expanse of the gesture is small. This gesture seems to be great for direct selections. However, contrarily to the previous one, it may be very costly to navigate into sub-menus. Indeed, the user may have to do a "complex" gesture at each step of his progress: he may have to draw the index of each sub-menu. On the contrary, the previous one allowed the user to reach a particular sub-menu in a continuous gesture.

                        <li><b>Back:</b> move hand in a circle-motion (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) </li>
                        <li><b>Home:</b> wave hand at least 3 times</li>
                    </ul>
                    Instructions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select Glee //one of the 6 recommendations</li>
                        <li>Go back to recs //quit full screen</li>
                        <li>Browse all //goes to all categories</li>
                        <li>Select a sci-fi movie //somewhat-buried show</li>
                        <li>Go back to selection menu //quit full screen</li>
                        <li>Select a “The Ring” //... another movie in another selection.</li>
                        <li>Go home </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We wanted the TV to show the top 6 recommendations for the user. If the user doesn't like the suggestions, he/she can go to "view all", and select the TV shows based that are listed by categories. The flow is shown both from the above insturctions and in the powerpoint document. One of the reasons we decided to go with this design was that it supports browsing a whole library of shows. This can be applicable to the on-demand "smart" TVs such as Google TV, Apple TV, and the traditional TVs that only allows the user to watch it in real-time.</p>
                    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
                    <p>The interface was too slow to navigate and cumbersome. Specific feedback from the grid was that there should be splits between columns and that the category buttons and shows should have different colors. Furthermore, arrows to different categories and shows weren’t clearly visible--and people preferred just to keep navigating “down” rather than having to push an arrow.</p>

										<p>Beyond interface-specific problems though, it was clear after the first couple users that the gestures did not map to any natural or expected behaviors, and that gestures were more of an obstacle than something that helped. Overall, the gestures seemed force and not easy to remember. We had someone come back to our station, try to use it without us teaching them, and she had already forgotten the selection gesture.</p>

            <h3>Wizard of Oz 2 - Radial menu navigation</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="span8 columns">
                    <h4>Use case</h4>
                    <p>Our second gestural navigation prototype was the radial menu. We hypothesized that there can be about 6 different shows going on at a given time in cable TV. Therefore recommendations were a core part of this system. Manually entering a station name/number was left as a last resort.</p>
                    <p>When the user waves at the screen, the first menu they see is the top 6 shows the system thinks s/he would be interested in. We haven't actually worked on the recommendation algorithm but we thought it was reasonable that based on past habits and a taste profile we could identify the top shows that are on right now for the user. If these top 6 suggestions were not adequate though, the user can navigate to more specific categories and genres for further recommendations.</p>
                    <p>We had one design for the interface but we tested two different interaction methods with it:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first UX method used a grab&select approach. To select an item or jump to a sub-category in a list the user could point at it with their open hand, then close their hand and pull it back to themselves. Similarly, to go back from a sub-category to a parent category the user could first close their hand (grasp) and then push back towards the screen.</li>
                            <li>The second method involed a free-moving viewport based on the user's motions. In this one, once the menu showed up, the path that the user takes with their arm would be replicated as the path that the viewport takes on the radial structure on the screen. This way, without the extra steps for selecting items, the user could simply skip to a leaf of the tree in one smooth motion, if they had internalized the gesture.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>The first piece of feedback we got was that this menu paradigm was preferable to the grid menu in a variety of ways. Its interaction was more predictable–moving around in a tree was a reasonable metaphor for the CS students that we tested with–and simpler.</p>
                    <p>We tried to test with our subjects with little to no instruction, and this gave us some very interesting results. Subjects tried to flick, pinch or even rotate the interface with gestures that are already familiar to them from touch screens or trackpads. We realized we could incorporate some other gestures such as a go back to root gesture (pushing the screen away with both hands).
